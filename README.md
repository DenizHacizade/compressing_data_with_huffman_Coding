# Compressing_Data_with_Huffman_Coding

Our function basically, gets daha from file and stores into the map in first.After 
that pushes into priority queue each char with its frequency.Secondly, with the help 
of createTree function creates nodes and pushes to queue.Lastly, with the help of a 
map container calls the recursive function and fills the map with char and its 
huffmancode.Then calls print functions to print out huffman and ascii version of text.
